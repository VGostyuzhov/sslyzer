Heartbleed;Heartbleed vulnerability\nThe Heartbleed bug allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software (CVE-2014-0160).;Critical
Crime;CRIME vulnerability\nCompression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy is a security exploit against secret web cookies over connections using the HTTPS and SPDY protocols that also use data compression (CVE-2012-4929).;Critical
Downgrade;Downgrade attack\nA downgrade attack allows for an attacker to negotiate a lower version of TLS between the client and server (CVE-2014-3511).;Medium
Poodle;POODLE attack\nThis vulnerability affects SSL 3 and CBC encryption mode in TLS and it allows a MITM attacker to decrypt the contents of the encrypted communication (CVE-2014-3511).;Critical
RC4;Vulnerabilities in RC4\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been found in SSLs RC4 implementation.;Medium
Beast;BEAST vulnerability\nBrowser Exploit Against SSL/TLS (BEAST) is an exploit that leverages weaknesses in CBC and allows for an attacker to perform MITM attack to decrypt and obtain authentication tokens (CVE-2011-3389).;Medium
CCS_Injection;CCS Injection\nChangeCipherSpec processing has a serious vulnerability that allows malicious intermediate nodes to intercept encrypted data and decrypt them while forcing SSL clients to use weak keys (CVE-2014-0224).;Medium
Drown;DROWN vulnerability\nIt allows attackers to break the encryption and read or steal sensitive communications, including passwords, credit card numbers, trade secrets, or financial data (CVE-2016-0800).;Medium
Freak;FREAK attack\nIt allows an attacker to intercept HTTPS connections between vulnerable clients and servers and force them to use weakened encryption, which the attacker can break to steal or manipulate sensitive data (CVE-2015-0204).;Medium
Logjam;Logjam attack\nIt allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to downgrade vulnerable TLS connections to 512-bit export-grade cryptography. This allows the attacker to read and modify any data passed over the connection.;Medium
